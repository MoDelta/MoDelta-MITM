# MyMITM

With this software, you can perform a man-in-the-middle attack on people you are on the same network with. With the man-in-the-middle attack, you can detect which sites the target visited, their passwords, etc. you can see. At the same time, you can predict the site he will visit and make him download malicious software through that site.

Use of : python3 arp_poison.py -t [] -g []

You write the target IP address where it says "-t" or "--target"

You write the modem IP address where it says "-g" or "--gateway"
